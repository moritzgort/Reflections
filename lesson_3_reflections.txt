When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To work on a project with multiple people or on different devices.

***

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe you want to change something at first or don’t even use the additional functionality of the new version. This way you have more power over the multiple files.

***

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks and Clones are almost the same. The only difference is when you fork a repository then you make a clone on GitHub. Cloning a repository means copying it to your hard drive. A branch is something very different. It’s a version of a file which is strongly interconnected with the other versions.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

That you have offline access when you don’t have any internet available.

***

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?

It would be very hard to keep track of all the files without Git. Additionally GitHub gives a great overview and extra features and functionality. There would be no upside in not using Git or GitHub in my opinion.

***

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

Using a separate branch is very useful for introducing a new feature hence it creates a totally new version which you can merge with master later on.

However this is pretty time consuming and you can easily forget a step or mess things up. Therefore you should always be sure if you want to just create a new commit or a totally new branch.
