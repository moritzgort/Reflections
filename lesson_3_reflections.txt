When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To work on a project with multiple people or on different devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe you want to change something at first or donâ€™t even use the additional functionality of the new version. This way you have more power over the multiple files.
