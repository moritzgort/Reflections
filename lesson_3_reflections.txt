When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

To work on a project with multiple people or on different devices.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Maybe you want to change something at first or don’t even use the additional functionality of the new version. This way you have more power over the multiple files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Forks and Clones are almost the same. The only difference is when you fork a repository then you make a clone on GitHub. Cloning a repository means copying it to your hard drive. A branch is something very different. It’s a version of a file which is strongly interconnected with the other versions.
